# Workout Tracker

## Description
Application that tracks workouts and excercises

## Technologies
The fronted for this app was gien, but it uses HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, and Semantic UI for the framework. The backend uses mongo for the database and express for the routes.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge was definitely just understanding the front end and what the app was actually supposed to do. The controllers was somewhat difficult to build at first because the app doesn't work very intuitively. For example, two diffent controllers were needed, but they both did the exact same thing.
